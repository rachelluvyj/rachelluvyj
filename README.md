# 🌷 Welcome to Michi's little corner! 🍓💫

## About Me 🐰

👋 Hii~ I’m **Michi**, born on **June 13, 2012** 🎂  
🎓 Currently in **Grade 8** and surviving it with ✨ pure ✨ willpower.  
💭 My MBTI is **ISTP-A** — basically cool, calm, and secretly chaotic hehe 😎  

🎬 I *absolutely love* the movie **20th Century Girl** (don’t talk to me about that ending 😭💔).

🎧 You’ll usually find me vibing to songs by **TXT, ENHYPEN, TWS, Cortis**, and random popular tracks that just *hit*. 

  ## 🐶 Meet My Dog — Yuki! ❄️

This is **Yuki**, my adorable **Shiba Inu** 🐕💕  
She’s basically the real main character in my life 😌

🏀 Used to play **basketball**, and honestly... not that bad at it 😉  
💌 Currently have no hobby except existing and pretending that’s productive ✨  

🐥 Thanks for visiting! Feel free to leave a ⭐ on one of my projects (I’ll probably cry from happiness hehe).
